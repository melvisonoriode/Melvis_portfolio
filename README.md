# [Project 2: Health and Retirement Study (HRS)](https://github.com/melvisonoriode/Melvis_portfolio/tree/main/Health%20and%20Retirement%20Study%20(HRS).)

 This Project considers data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This study is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of Americans over age 50 conducted by the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). This study interviews approximately 20,000 respondents on health care, housing, assets, pensions, employment, and disability every two years. 
The study is managed through a cooperative agreement (NIA U01AG009740) between the NIA, which provides primary funding, and the ISR, which administers and conducts the survey. 
This detailed information allows one to develop models of healthcare use to predict future expenditures. We consider HRS data from the 9th follow-up that consists of 9,762 individuals. 

1. Clean up data remove rows with missing values and report the number of cases I used for the rest of the analysis.  
2. Created a scatterplot matrix of all Variable 
3. Fitted regression models using the regsubsets() function from the leaps package and store it as an R object. Showed the summary. 
4. Create a model matrix from the test data set. Calculate the validation error for the test data set for all the 15 models you got in question
