The dataset contains the following columns:
1. Position - position of the track in the top 200
2.Track Name - track name
3.Artist - the performer of the track
4.Streams- the number of listens
5.Date- the date on which the top 200 is formed
6.Genre- genres to which the track belongs (presented as an array)
